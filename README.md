## üìã Project Overview

TaskFlow is a comprehensive household task management system that demonstrates proficiency in modern web development practices, backend architecture, and database design. The application features a sophisticated points-based gamification system, real-time analytics, and a responsive, user-friendly interface.

### Key Features Implemented

- **Multi-tenant Household System** - Secure user authentication with household-based access control
- **Advanced Task Management** - Priority levels, difficulty scoring, recurring tasks, and automatic urgency calculation
- **Gamification Engine** - Points system, streak tracking, achievement badges, and leaderboards
- **Real-time Analytics** - Comprehensive statistics, performance metrics, and visual dashboards
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with modern glassmorphism UI
- **Role-based Permissions** - Admin/member roles with appropriate access controls

## üõ† Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Laravel 12.x (PHP 8.2+)
- **Database**: SQLite (configurable for MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze with custom middleware
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with Service-Repository layers
- **Testing**: Pest/PHPUnit for feature and unit tests

### Frontend
- **Views**: Blade templating with Alpine.js for reactivity
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component system
- **Build Tool**: Vite for asset compilation
- **Icons**: Heroicons SVG library

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git with semantic commits
- **Code Quality**: PSR-12 standards, PHPStan analysis
- **Database**: Laravel Eloquent ORM with migrations
- **Caching**: Built-in Laravel caching system

## üèó Architecture & Design Patterns

### Backend Architecture
```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Http/Controllers/     # Request handling and routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/              # Eloquent models with relationships
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Policies/            # Authorization logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Middleware/          # Request filtering and authentication
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Http/Requests/       # Form validation and sanitization

database/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/          # Database schema definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ seeders/            # Test data generation
```

### Key Technical Implementations

**1. Sophisticated Task Scoring Algorithm**
```php
public function calculateUrgencyScore(): float
{
    $hoursUntilDue = $now->diffInHours($this->due_date, false);
    $timeScore = max(0, 100 - ($hoursUntilDue / 24));

    $priorityMultiplier = match($this->priority) {
        'urgent' => 2.0,
        'high' => 1.5,
        'medium' => 1.0,
        'low' => 0.5,
    };

    return round($timeScore * $priorityMultiplier, 2);
}
```

**2. Dynamic Points Calculation System**
- Creation points: 100 per task
- Completion points: 30 √ó difficulty level
- Streak bonuses: 5 points per consecutive day
- Completion rate bonuses: Up to 20 points for 100% completion

**3. Real-time Statistics Engine**
```php
public function updateStats()
{
    // Calculate completion rates, streaks, and point totals
    // Update household balance metrics
    // Generate performance analytics
}
```

## üìä Database Schema Highlights

### Core Relationships
- **Users** belong to **Households** (multi-tenancy)
- **Tasks** have polymorphic relationships with categories, assignees, and creators
- **TaskStats** track individual and household performance metrics
- **TaskActivityLogs** provide complete audit trails

### Advanced Features
- Soft deletes for data recovery
- JSON columns for flexible configuration
- Optimized queries with eager loading
- Database-level constraints and indexes

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js & npm
- SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL
